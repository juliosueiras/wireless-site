If an ACK frame is not received by the original transmitting radio, the unicast frame is not acknowledged and will have to be retransmitted. This process does not specifically determine whether a collision occurs. Failure to receive an ACK frame from the receiver means that either a unicast frame was not received by the destination station or the ACK frame was not received, but it cannot positively determine the cause.
